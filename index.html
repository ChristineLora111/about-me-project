            After leaving the military, I started a new career as a network engineer focussed on Cisco network infrastructure. I focussed primarily on security networks and soon made my way up to Senior Network Engineer. As I progressed in technical knowledge and skills, I began to lead engineering teams and eventually became the engineering manager at my company. I currently sit as a Technical Program Manager and Manager of Engineering for Core infrastructure Serivces. I manage multi-million dollar programs and ensure customer goals are met with top notch engineering services.
